# OddEvenSort

- Program parameters in the console: Number of Threads.
They are "run" for execution at the beginning of the program and run until the end of the program (until the job specified in the task is completed).

- Must be performed on a computer with at least 8 physical cores;

- The command line must have additional parameters, such as the number of working threads and the "load" parameter, which defines the amount of work (eg accuracy, array size, etc.).

**Overall, the program should simply run an Odd-Even sort algorithm with java threads.**
